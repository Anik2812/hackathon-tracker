# Hackathon Tracker

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create **Hackathon Tracker** by the need for a simple tool to monitor and visualize our hackathon experiences. We wanted a way to keep track of our progress, celebrate wins, and learn from our losses.

## What it does

**Hackathon Tracker** is a web app that allows users to log their hackathon events, track which ones they’ve won or lost, and view their success rate through an interactive pie chart. It’s designed to help users stay motivated and organized throughout their hackathon journey.

## How we built it

We built Hackathon Tracker using modern web technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js for the interactive pie chart
- **DataBase:** MongoDB to store user data, profile pictures and hackathons

The frontend provides a clean and user-friendly interface, while the backend handles data management and API requests.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Data Visualization:** Ensuring the pie chart accurately reflected wins and losses required careful data handling and Chart.js configuration.
- **User Interface Design:** Balancing functionality with visual appeal was challenging, but we aimed for a design that was both effective and engaging.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of

We’re proud of creating an intuitive and visually appealing app that effectively tracks hackathon events and provides meaningful insights through a pie chart. The seamless user experience and data management features are key accomplishments.

## What we learned

We learned valuable lessons in data visualization, user interface design, and integrating frontend and backend technologies. We also gained insights into how to manage and present data effectively.

## What’s next for Hackathon Tracker

We plan to add features like event reminders, performance analytics, and user profiles. We also aim to enhance the app with more interactive elements and explore opportunities for community engagement.
